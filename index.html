				<h3>THE STORY</h3>


				<p>Donald Trump is a uniquely dangerous threat to America and the nature of our democracy. His authoritarian tendencies, sadistic vindictiveness, boundless narcissism and greed, and wanton ignorance of key issues combine to make him a menace far outside the normal Democratic/Republican divide. Millions more Americans oppose than support him - he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes and has only become less popular since taking office. To defeat Trump and his agenda, we must continue the spirit of protest, opposition, and resistance that began with the Women's March on January 21, 2017. We need a constant drumbeat to sustain that momentum, nudge people in the direction of courage, and ultimately galvanize voter turnout in 2018 and 2020. In support of other ongoing resistance movements, Fallada Project is a drumbeat.</p>


				<p>In Berlin during World War II, a working class couple decided to oppose Hitler in whatever way they could. They knew the risks, but also knew they could not live with themselves if they did nothing. Given limited means, they struggled with how to resist, eventually deciding to leave single postcards around the city - dropped mostly in stairwells and mailboxes. The cards encouraged the people of Berlin to rise up and refuse to cooperate with the Nazis. Almost every card dropped was turned into the authorities; people were terrified to be caught with them. Eventually the couple was discovered, arrested, and executed. Hans Fallada fictionalizes this true story in his book "Every Man Dies Alone," one of the great literary works on resistance. In prison awaiting their fate, the couple had no regrets. They knew, in the face of great danger, they had done what they could.</p>

					<p>This story is the inspiration for Fallada Project. Through this modernized postcard campaign, Fallada Project encourages people to do what they can to fight back. The project involves members of the resistance leaving stamped, addressed cards around their communities where people find them and mail them to the White House. Each time you drop a card, you've made a local protest. Each time you mail a card, you've made a national protest. The cards are easily recognizable when found "in the wild" and documentable on social media via #falladaproject. When mailed, each card also reminds Trump he was not the choice of the American people.</p>


					<p>There will be many bad days between now and the next elections. We must steel ourselves for the fight. Fallada Project is a way to protest every day, encourage each other through the dark times, and sustain ourselves until we can defeat Trump and his agenda at the polls.</p>
